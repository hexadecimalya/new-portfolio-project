          My name is Alina and I am 31 years old. Everyone might be expecting to
          see my great abilities in web development here, but I have to
          disappoint you a little. I didn't come into development straight away.
          Circumstances have come to the point where, here and now, I'm writing
          this portfolio.

          I graduated from NTUU KPI with a bachelor's degree, and from CHNTU
          with a master's degree in software engineering. Practice at the
          institute led me to system analysis and writing my first technical
          assignment for the Kiev State Permit Centre. At first, I worked for 3
          years as a software engineer for a local internet service provider.
          Then I wrote the technical documentation for
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dH1bv9fAxiY">the NSC</a>
          integrated control system, which was being thrust on ChNPP Unit 4.

          At the end of 2015, I took part with an initiative team in the
          creation and holding of the

            >International Conference on Nuclear Decommissioning and
            Environmental Recovery</a

          International Conference on Nuclear Decommissioning and Environmental
          Recovery (INUDECO) in my town - Slavutych. It was a very specific but
          terribly interesting experience.

          In 2016 we set up a company called DigitalDataPro to solve various
          tasks in text recognition and data processing. I had absolutely no
          involvement in development because I was the director of this company.

          In 2017 I had a son, Vince. Everything turned upside down (it happens
          that way, you know...) and only after 2 years I was able to start a
          new job.

          I was invited to Ukrainian WTBit project as a translator and that's
          how the official
          <a href="https://bitcoin.org/files/bitcoin-paper/bitcoin_uk.pdf"
            >Ukrainian Bitcoin Whitepaper</a
          >
          appeared. It was hard to stop, so I translated almost the whole book
          "Inadequate Equilibria: Where and How Civilizations Get Stuck" by the
          great and incomparable Eliezer Yudkowsky into Ukrainian.

          A little later I became co-owner of a small cosy
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/marktim.shop/"
            >shop with goods from Europe</a
          >. It was the perfect platform for experimentation because I could be
          in the role of photographer, designer, creative director, supply
          manager and, of course, salesperson. My colleague and I had the whole
          cycle of this shop on our shoulders - from selecting products on the
          shelves of foreign shops to selling them. I worked hard and took
          photographs, and it paid off.

          ... A sudden war knocked the ground out from under me. Our town was
          cut off from food and medical supplies for a month, all roads were
          blocked and there was active fighting around town. Ten days without
          electricity in the middle of winter and endless air raids left an
          indelible impression on me and my family, so after a month we drove as
          far through the forest as we could see at our own risk.

          We could only stop at Gran Canaria because there was nowhere else to
          run. This is where I decided to go back to my roots and try my hand at

          I love photography, yoga and a bit of travelling. I am always open to
          new things. Once I worked with two colleagues to install a new antenna
          on
          <a href="https://www.chernobyl.one/duga-1-radar-station/"
            >the Duga radar</a
          >
          (Russian Woodpecker, 150 meters height) in the Chernobyl zone.
          Although I'm terrified of heights, I had to climb up without any
          equipment. After this incident, I drew a conclusion:
          <strong>You have to move not only forward, but also upwards.</strong>
