        Please, daddy, I swear I will finish this section next week
      </h2>
      <p class="text-black">
        My name is Alina and I am 31 years old. Everyone might be expecting to
        see my great abilities in web development here, but I have to disappoint
        you a little. I didn't come into development straight away.
        Circumstances have come to the point where, here and now, I'm writing
        this portfolio. I graduated from NTUU KPI with a bachelor's degree, and
        from CHNTU with a master's degree in software engineering. Practice at
        the institute led me to system analysis and writing my first technical
        assignment for the Kiev State Permit Centre. At first, I worked for 3
        years as a software engineer for a local internet service provider. Then
        I wrote the technical documentation for the NSC integrated control
        system, which was being thrust on ChNPP Unit 4. At the end of 2015, I
        took part with an initiative team in the creation and holding of the
        International Conference on Nuclear Decommissioning and Environmental
        Recovery (INUDECO) in my town - Slavutych. It was a very specific but
        terribly interesting experience. In 2016 we set up a company called
        DigitalDataPro to solve various tasks in text recognition and data
        processing. I had absolutely no involvement in development because I was
        the director of this company. In 2017 I had a son, Vince. Everything
        turned upside down (it happens that way, you know...) and only after 2
        years I was able to start a new business. I was invited to Ukrainian
        WTBit project as a translator and that's how the official Ukrainian
        Bitcoin Whitepaper appeared. It was hard to stop, so I translated almost
        the whole book "Inadequate Equilibria: Where and How Civilizations Get
        Stuck" by the great and incomparable Eliezer Yudkowsky into Ukrainian. A
        little later I became co-owner of a small cosy shop with goods from
        Europe. It was the perfect platform for experimentation because I could
        be in the role of photographer, designer, creative director, supply
        manager and, of course, salesperson. My colleague and I had the whole
        cycle of this shop on our shoulders - from selecting products on the
        shelves of foreign shops to selling them. I worked hard and took
        photographs, and it paid off. ... A sudden war knocked the ground out
        from under me. Our town was cut off from food and medical supplies for a
        month, all roads were blocked and there was active fighting around town.
        Ten days without electricity in the middle of winter and endless air
        raids left an indelible impression on me and my family, so after a month
        we drove as far through the forest as we could see at our own risk. We
        could only stop at Gran Canaria because there was nowhere else to run.
        This is where I decided to go back to my roots and try my hand at being
        a front-end developer. I love photography, yoga and a bit of travelling.
        I am always open to new things. Once I worked with two colleagues to
        install a new antenna on the Duga radar (Russian Woodpecker, 150 meters
        height) in the Chernobyl zone. Although I'm terrified of heights, I had
        to climb up without any equipment. After this incident, I drew a
        conclusion: You have to move not only forward, but also upwards.
